# TheWebFor5

This is a blog platform founded by [Dillion Megida](https://twitter.com/iamdillion) for demystifying web development topics. This hopes to be different from other blog platforms such that the topics aren't entirely explained in technical terms but simpler ones that can be easily consumed by a reader.
