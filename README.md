# TheWebFor5
This is a blog platform founded by [Dillion Megida](https://twitter.com/iamdillion) for demystifying web topics as assumed to be teaching a five year old. This this hopes to be different from other blog platforms such that the topics aren't entirely explained in technical terms but simpler ones which a five year old would understand.

It is a static site meaning that all contents are already on the website. The site doesn't pull data from any database.
